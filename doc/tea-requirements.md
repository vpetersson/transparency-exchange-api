# TEA Requirements

## Repository discovery

Based on an identifier a repository URL needs to be found. The identifier can be:

- PURL
- Product name or Product SKU and vendor name
- EAN bar code
- Product SKU
- Vendor UUID
- Hash of object

At the base URL well known URLs (ref) needs to point to

- A lifecycle status document (using OWASP Common Lifecycle Enumeration, CLE)
- A version list. For each version, a URL will point to where a **collection** can be found
- Vendor Discovery, returns a list of Vendors represented in the repository
  - Vendor Name
  - Vendor ID

As an alternative, discovery using a company's ordinary web site should be supported. This can be handled using the file
security.txt (IETF RFC 9116)

## Artifact Discovery based on TEA collections

The API MUST provide a way to discover the artifacts that are available for retrieval or further query. Discovery SHOULD
group artifacts together that represent a **collection** that are directly applicable to a given product with a given
version. Collections are OPTIONAL.

- SBOM - Software Bill of Material
- CBOM - Cryptography Bill of Material
- HBOM - Hardware Bill of Material
- VDR - Vulnerability Disclosure Report
- VEX - Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange
- CDXA - Attestation

Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Collection Management

The API SHOULD provide a method to manage collections, such as adding new collections, modifying collections, or
deleting existing collections.

- Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Artifact Retrieval

The API MUST provide a method in which to retrieve an artifact based on the identity of the artifact. For example, using
CycloneDX BOM-Link to retrieve either the latest version or specific version of an artifact.

```text
urn:cdx:serialNumber
urn:cdx:serialNumber/version
```

The API needs to provide support for update checks, i.e. to check if a document is updated without downloading.
(possibly etag or HEAD method or similar) Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Artifact Publishing

The API MUST provide a way to publish an artifact, either standalone or to a collection. The detection of duplicate
artifacts with the same identity MUST be handled and prevented. Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Artifact Versioning

The system and API must support artifact versioning for formats that support versioning such as CycloneDX. For example:

- The ability to retrieve the latest SBOM vs a previous (uncorrected) version of the same SBOM. Corrections to SBOMs is
  a supported use case in the NTIA framing document.
- The ability to retrieve the latest VEX along with previous VEX for the same product so that time-series decisions are
  transparently available.

Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## insights: Search Artifact Inventory

The API MUST provide a way to search the inventory of a specific BOM or all available BOMs for a given component or
service. The API SHOULD support multiple identity formats including PURL, CPE, SWID, GAV, GTIN, and GMN.

For example:

- Return the identity of all BOMs that have a vulnerable version of Apache Log4J:
  `pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.10.0`

The API MUST provide a way to search for the metadata component across all available BOMs. The API SHOULD support
multiple identity formats including PURL, CPE, SWID, GAV, GTIN, and GMN. For example:

- Return the identity of all artifacts that describe `cpe:/a:acme:commerce_suite:1.0`.

Authn/Authz MUST be supported
