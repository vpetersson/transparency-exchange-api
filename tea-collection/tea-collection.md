# The TEA Collection object (TCO)

For each product and version there is a Tea Collection object, which is a list of available artifacts for this specific
version. The TEA Index is a list of TEA collections.

The TEA collection is normally created by the TEA application server at publication time of artifacts. The publisher may
sign the collection object as a JSON file at time of publication.

If there are any updates of artifacts within a collection for the same version of a product, then a new TEA Collection
object is created and signed. This update will have the same UUID, but a new version number. A reason for the update
will have to be provided. This shall be used to correct mistakes, spelling errors as well as to provide new information
on dynamic artifact types such as LCE or VEX. If the product is modified, that is a new product version and that should
generate a new collection object with a new UUID and updated metadata.

## Dynamic or static Collection objects

The TCO is produced by the TEA software platform. There are two ways to implement this:

- **Dynamic**: The TCO is built for each API request and created dynamically.
- **Static**: The TCO is built at publication time as a static object by the publisher. This object can be digitally
  signed at publication time.

## Collection object

The TEA Collection object has the following parts

- Preamble
  - UUID of the TEA collection object (TCO)
  - Product name
  - Product version
  - Product Release date (timestamp)
  - Author of the collection object
    - Name
    - Email
    - Organisation
  - Reason for update/release of TCO
    - ENUM reason
    - clear text
      - "New product release"
      - "Corrected dependency in SBOM that was faulty"
      - "Added missing In-Toto build attestation"
- List of artifact objects (see below)
- Optional Signature of the collection object

The artifact object has the following parts

- Artifact UUID
- Artifact name
- Author of the artifact object
  - Name
  - Email
  - Organisation
- List of objects with the same content, but in different formats. The order of the list has no significance.
  - UUID for subdoc
  - Optional BOM identifier
    - SPDX or CycloneDX reference to BOM
  - MIME media type
  - Artifact category (enum)
    - <https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/#externalReferences_items_type>
  - Description in clear text
  - Direct URL for downloads of artefact
  - Direct URL for download of external signature
  - Size in bytes
  - SHA384 checksum

## The reason for TCO update enum

| ENUM        | Explanation                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| VEXUPDATE   | Updated the VEX artefact(s)    |
| SBOMUPDATE  | Updated the SBOM artefact(s)   |
| OTHERUPDATE | Updated another artefact       |
| LCECHANGE   | Updated Life cycle enumeration |

    * NEWVERSION - A new version of the product
    * ADDITION - Adding an artifact
    * REMOVE - Removing an artifact
    * UPDATE - Update of artifacts (typos, faults)
